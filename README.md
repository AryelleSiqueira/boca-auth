# boca-ldap

## Requirements

* Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
* Install [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

## Quick Start

* Open a Terminal window and make sure the Docker engine is up and running:

```sh
# List docker images
docker images -a
# List containers
docker container ls -a
```

* Clone this repo and run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aryellesiqueira/boca-ldap.git
cd boca-ldap
docker compose up -d
```

Voil√†! The application should be running now.

* Open a web browser and visit the URL [http://localhost:8000/boca](http://localhost:8000/boca). First, create and activate a BOCA contest (user: _system_ | password: _boca_). Then, login as admin (user: _admin_ | password: _boca_) to manage users, problems, languages etc.

* To stop the application (considering that the shell is in the same directory):

```sh
docker compose down
```
